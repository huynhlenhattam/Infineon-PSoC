# Vibrational Frequency Measurement System using HB100 radar sensor and PSoC 5LP
The vibration is measured by the HB100 Doppler radar sensor. The analog waveform from the sensor is sampled and quantized by ADC and analyzed by FFT from ARM CMSIS-DSP library (Add the folder Core and DSP from ARM.CMSIS.5.7.0 (Download link: https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/releases/) to the project directory (More instructions: https://community.infineon.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/Including-CMSIS5-Library-in-a-PSoC-Creator-project-KBA232412/ta-p/282647)), which are both implemented on PSoC 5LP. The strongest frequency component is displayed on the LCD. This project can also be used for speed measurement.
