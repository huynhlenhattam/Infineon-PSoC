# Car Speed Measurement System using HB100 radar sensor and PSoC 5LP
The car speed is measured by the HB100 Doppler radar sensor (The speed is proportional to the Doppler frequency generated by the sensor). The analog waveform from the sensor is sampled and quantized by ADC and analyzed by FFT from ARM CMSIS-DSP library (Add the folder Core and DSP from ARM.CMSIS.5.7.0 (Download link: https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/releases/) to the project directory (More instructions: https://community.infineon.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/Including-CMSIS5-Library-in-a-PSoC-Creator-project-KBA232412/ta-p/282647)), which are both implemented on PSoC 5LP. The strongest frequency component is detected and the speed of the car can be calculated. Both of them are displayed on the LCD.
